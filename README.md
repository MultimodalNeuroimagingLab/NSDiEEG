# NSDiEEG

This is a **Work In Progress** repository for code related to the NSD iEEG project.

This project aims to establish an intensive iEEG dataset that can be used to advance models of human vision and provide temporal detail throughout the human visual pathways. Raw and preprocessed data will be shared and preprocessed data will contain different types of neural responses: high frequency broadband signals, low frequency narrowband signals and evoked potentials. These data are designed to be used in conjunction with the [Natural Scenes Dataset](https://naturalscenesdataset.org/) collected with 7T fMRI.

## Methodological notes

### Subjects
Analyses are written for data from 19 subjects who were implanted with sEEG electrodes for clinical purposes. Data were collected in two additional subjects, but these are excluded because of atypical physiology (nystagmus and epilepsy affecting visual responses). All subjects provided informed consent to participate in research and the study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB.

### Stimulus presentation
Subjects looked at the 1000 special NSD images (that fMRI subjects saw 3x) for 800 ms on, 800 ms off. Images were displayed at a size of 27x27 degrees of visual angle.

### iEEG data collection
Data were collected using a g.HiAmp amplifier (gTec) at 1200 Hz (subjects 1-X) and 2400 Hz (subjects X-19).

### Eye tracking
Eye tracking data were collected using a Tobii Pro Spectrum at 1200Hz.
